# roman_numeral_to_integer
Function that converts a roman numeral string into its integer value

Done for leetcode challenge "13. Roman to Interger." My method is a bit slow and convoluted but it gets the job done,
I haven't written python in a while. It essentially traverses the string backwards and runs thru some if statements
to determine what to add to the sum accumulator.
